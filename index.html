<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION:Create a website with your homepage, other web page(s), and a copy of your resume (other appropriate linked document).

REQUIREMENTS:  Using an editor such as Notepad, create a website consisting of at least two main X/HTML pages – a home page and another page, such as a copy of your resume -- you may use the resume that you used for the Word project (#2)  with a fictitious name if it is not professional enough to display to the world).  You MUST, however, convert it to X/HTML if you want to count it.

Your home page should have at least the following minimum features:

DTD line at top
Basic tags (head, body, title)
Use of bold, italicization, and underlining
One or more graphics using the img tag
One or more links using the href tag
One or more tables using table tags (table, td, tr)
Two or more of the different heading types/sizes (h1...h6)
At least one ordered and one unordered lists (ul, ol, li)
Make sure that your pages follow proper xhtml format.  Then publish your Website to the Internet (preferably to the NOVA student webpage site as we did in class).  Email me the URL for your website. [alt: if you cannot get your pages to upload, then save all of the files to one medium –  CD-R(/W) or DVD-R(/W) and turn it in to me, but remember that the final uploaded version is 10 points of the grade.]  Please, no flash drives!
